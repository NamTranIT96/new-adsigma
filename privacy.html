    </p>
    <p>
        Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and failure to provide this Data
        may
        make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases where this Application specifically
        states
        that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this Data without consequences to the
        availability or the functioning of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.
        Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of third-party services
        used
        by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other
        purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this Application
        and
        confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Mode and place of processing the Data
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Methods of processing
    </h4>
    <p>
        The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
        unauthorized destruction of the Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures
        and
        modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be
        accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application
        (administration,
        sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service
        providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as
        Data
        Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Legal basis of processing
    </h4>
    <p>
        The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
    </p>
    <ul style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14px">
        <li>
            Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner
            may be
            allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to
            rely
            on
            consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
            Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
        </li>
        <li>
            provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
            pre-contractual
            obligations thereof;
        </li>
        <li>

            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
            processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
            authority
            vested in the Owner;
        </li>
        <li>
            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third
            party.
            In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
            and
            in
            particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
            requirement
            necessary to enter into a contract.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and
        in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
        necessary to enter into a contract.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Place
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the
        processing are located.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other
        than
        their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section
        containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union
        or
        to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such
        as
        the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
    </p>
    If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or
    inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.

    <h3>
        Retention time
    </h3>
    <p>
        Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore:
    </p>
    <ul style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14px">
        <li>
            Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User
            shall
            be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as
            needed to
            fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the
            Owner
            within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such
        processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal
        Data
        for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an
        authority.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
        erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the
        retention period.
    </p>

    <h3>
        The purposes of processing
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Service, comply with its legal
        obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of its Users or third
        parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent activity, as well as the following: Access to third party services'
        accounts, Managing contacts and sending messages, Interaction with external social networks and platforms,
        Registration and authentication provided directly by this Application, Analytics, Registration and
        authentication,
        Displaying content from external platforms, User database management, Contacting the User, SPAM protection,
        Hosting
        and backend infrastructure and Connecting Data.
    </p>

        GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)
    </div>
    <p>Last updated on May 24, 2018</p>

    <p>
        On May 25th, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will take effect. The GDPR is the European Union’s
        new data privacy law which impacts how all companies (big and small) collect and handle personal data about
        their European customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        We support the GDPR and will ensure all Adsigma apps and services comply with its provisions by May 25, 2018.
        Not only is the GDPR an important step in protecting the fundamental right of privacy for European citizens, it
        also raises the bar for data protection, security, and compliance in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is the GDPR?</p>
    <p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new European privacy law that goes into effect on May 25,
        2018. The GDPR will replace the EU Data Protection Directive, also known as Directive 95/46/EC, and will apply a
        single data protection law throughout the EU.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data protection laws govern the way that businesses collect, use, and share personal data about individuals.
        Among other things, they require businesses to process an individual’s personal data fairly and lawfully, allow
        individuals to exercise legal rights in respect of their personal data (for example, to access, correct or
        delete their personal data), and ensure appropriate security protections are put in place to protect the
        personal data they process.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have taken steps to ensure that we will be compliant with the GDPR by May 25, 2018.</p>
    <p>
        Who does the GDPR apply to?</p>
    <p>
        The GDPR applies to all entities and individuals based in the EU and to entities and individuals, whether or not
        based in the EU, that process the personal data of EU individuals. The GDPR defines personal data as any
        information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This is a broad definition and includes
        data that is obviously personal (such as an individual’s name or contact details) as well as data that can be
        used to identify an individual indirectly (such as an individual’s IP address).
    </p>
    <p>
        What are the permissions we need for "Search Product" app?</p>
    <p>
        Read_Products</p>
    <p>
        This includes products and collections. We need this permission to sync the product, collection data between
        your Shopify store and our app for filtering and searching features.
    </p>
